## Paxos Distributed Consensus System

This project implements a distributed **Paxos-based consensus algorithm** to ensure reliable agreement across multiple nodes in a distributed environment. The system is containerized using **Docker** and deployed on **Kubernetes**, enabling scalability, resilience, and fault tolerance.

### Features
- Multiple Paxos acceptor nodes
- Leader proposal and consensus agreement
- Handles node failures and recovery
- Dynamic scaling with Kubernetes
- REST APIs for communication
- Demonstrates distributed system fundamentals:
  - Consensus
  - Replication
  - Availability
  - Reliability

This project showcases how modern DevOps tools and distributed algorithms work together to build robust systems.
